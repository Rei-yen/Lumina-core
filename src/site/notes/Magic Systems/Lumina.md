**Lumina** is a chemical "element" that was carried to Earth 65 Million Years Ago in The Fall of Ouranos; it has the symbol **L** and atomic number **0**, which is why it is also referred to as **Element Zero**.

Under standard conditions, Lumina exists as singular particles dispersed throughout the air necessary to sustain "magic". It stores potential energy as distortions in its stabilizing field. When the field collapses in or itself or is manipulated, energy is released that moves molecules and atoms. Stars, including the Sun, was found to utilize Element Zero alongside hydrogen. ₀L consists of **multiple neutrons**, **no protons** and **one electron**. It is odorless, usually colorless and not combustible; the way it acts is more similar to photons rather compared to actual elements.

Lumina does not contain any protons. Rather, it forms "**pseudo-atoms**" that acts as a proton using a self-generated **Luminal Field**. This field substitutes for electromagnetic force normally provided by protons, allowing Lumina to integrate with matter, carry energy, and resonate with biological systems. 

Due to the nature of Lumina being fundamentally different from the defining characteristics of other Elements, scientists no longer consider it an Element and has categorized it as a **quasi-stable particle**.
